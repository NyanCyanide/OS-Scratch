Process  : 1
Concepts : Assembler, BIOS
Goal     : Create a file which the BIOS interprests as a bootable disk

>== Threory ==<

=> When the computer boots, the BIOS doesn't know how to load the OS, so it deleggates that task to the boot sector.
=> Thus boot sector must be placed in a known, stadard location.
=> That location would be first sector of the disk and occupies 512 bytes.

=> To make sure that the "disk is bootable", the BIOS checks that bytes 511 and 512 of the alleged boot sector are bytes 0xAA55

Simplest boot Sector :

    e9 fd ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    [  29 more lines with sixteen zero-bytes each ]
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 aa

*** x86 is little endian, ending with 16-bit value 0xAA55, first three bytes perform an infinte jump

=> Performs Infinte loop! and also displayinhg Booting from Hard Disk!!
